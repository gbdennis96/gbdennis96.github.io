As a kid, and as a busy adult, I have always had a love for videogames. Thankfully I was born around the time computers started to advance more and more. I was always interested in how games could be made on almost any electronic, and was curious as to how. During my senior year of high school, I decided to take an "Intro to Web Design" course for college credit. There I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, and also how to make a Flash game strictly from code and images found on the internet. It was very baisic, but I realized the potential! From there I decided that I would major in Animation in college, for my love for video games and my new-found interest in Software Development. Of course, life happened and I wasn't able to complete college. After years of going from job-to-job and realizing a photography business could fail at any time (and unfornately COVID-19), I realized I needed to find something more concret and stick with it. With months of research I came across Flat Iron School, and now I'm blogging as part of my first assignmet! :)
